Several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing a mask helps protect those around you, in case you are asymptomatic. \n\n3. Clean your hands before / after using mask , or whenever you touch it.\n\n4. Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. Importantly, dont use masks with valves. ',

Take care of your body and mind, by taking deep breaths, stretches and meditation.Physical activities are vital to keep the body healthy and fit.\n\n  3.
